​It was great talking with you.  The "DEVELOPER TASK" is a coding test that is sent to potential python developers.   Please complete the QA TASK and respond with your results.
 
QA TASK
State any assumptions and/or additional details needed for proper testing
Define test cases that can be used in test automation
Code some examples of these test cases
Not all defined test cases need to be coded
The attached "img_count_output.txt" file is a piped result of executing the DEVELOPER TASK.
Use your desired language
Must be able to run in standard Linux terminal
Note any requirements needed to run the the tests

DEVELOPER  TASK

We want to create an IMDB clone, with the twist that we only display
the pages for movies that are in theaters. As part of this, we want to
get a count of images to approximate how much storage space we need.
 
You need to do the following:
- Use the rottentomatoes.com API to get the list of movies currently in theaters
 
- For-each movie in the list, download it's matching IMDB page and get
  a count of the number of images in the page.
 
Write a Python program, img_count.py, that implements this.
 
OUTPUT
A JSON list of objects that looks like this:
[
 {
    "url": "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1229340", 
    "count": 71, 
    "imdb_id": "1229340"
  }
]
Each movie in the in-theaters list must have an entry in the result.
 
REQUIREMENTS
The program must be a Python file named img_count.py
 
It must be able to run in a standard Linux terminal
 
img_count.py must be able to be run as either a shell script or via %
python img_count.py
 
img_count.py must print the expected output (as above) to stdout
 
The program must complete execution in under 8 seconds, and will be
timed using the Linux 'time' command.​
